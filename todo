parser:
* Add error handling for patch parsing, so a single failed patch does not kill the whole parsing
* Add option for parsing selected patches and appending/replacing them to an existing patch json failed
* Implement parsing for patch format 1
* Allow specification of output file, existing files get overwritten or appended if specified
  * data_dir must not be global var anymore
  * if output file not specified, write into local dir as patch-timestamp ?
* Add error handling or other method for reading parser_config
* Add option to store downloaded html files somewhere if specified?
  * Also allow parsing of those downloaded html files

* Merge duplicate code from modules
* Somehow microservice it up
